# 1. Two Sum

- **LeetCode:** https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Topics:** Array, Hash Table

## Description

You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return *indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`*.

You may assume that each input would have ***exactly* one solution**, and you may not use the *same* element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** `nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9`

**Output:** `[0,1]`

**Explanation:**

The sum of `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` is `2 + 7 = 9`, which equals the target. Therefore, the indices `[0, 1]` are returned.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** `nums = [3,2,4], target = 6`

**Output:** `[1,2]`

**Explanation:**

The sum of `nums[1]` and `nums[2]` is `2 + 4 = 6`, which equals the target. Therefore, the indices `[1, 2]` are returned.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** `nums = [3,3], target = 6`

**Output:** `[0,1]`

**Explanation:**

The sum of `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` is `3 + 3 = 6`, which equals the target. Therefore, the indices `[0, 1]` are returned.

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `-10^9 <= target <= 10^9`
- **Only one valid answer exists.**

 **Follow-up: **Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than `O(n^2)` time complexity?
